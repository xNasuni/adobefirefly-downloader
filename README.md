# adobefirefly-downloader

This can download images from adobe firefly without the watermark. Generate the images you want then open the console (CTRL + Shift + I) then run [this](https://github.com/xNasuni/adobefirefly-downloader/blob/main/universal-main.js) script.

> This script downloads the images and saves the **image data** to a file called "firefly-" and then the **current unix time**, the image index with a suffix of a "@", and the file extension will be a **.jpg**

### Updates
> Now works for **Text To Image** and **Generative Recolor** - ***(6/15/2023)***<br/>
> Now works for **Text Effects** - ***(6/17/2023***

## Extra Information

> intended for [adobe firefly](https://firefly.adobe.com)<br/>
> thank you~!<br/>
> **I recommend not to use this script for the Text Effects because you can simply download it from adobe and remove the watermark since there is nothing there most of the time and downloading it from the canvas makes it look pixelated!**
